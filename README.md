# Telegram Bot

This obsoletes the [bot written in fish](https//github.com/Hakimi0804/tgbot-fish).

## Usage

1. Get bot token from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)
1. Run credentials.py and paste the bot token (`python3 credentials.py`)
1. Run the bot (`python3 main.py`)

for details on how to make a module for the bot, refer [this](modules/README.md)

## Warnings
This codebase is pure cancer btw, not that I cannot write clean code, but I'm too
lazy to do so :p

## Sample Text for `modules/ai_spam_detection.py`
This can be used to test ai backend. Should give positive result.
